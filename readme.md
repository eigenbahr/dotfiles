Dotfiles
========

This project contains all my shell dotfiles, environment con fig,
aliases, git config, etc, that I want to keep across machines.  

To use this project:

* Clone this repository in your home directory
* Create these symlinks:

    * `$ ln -s bash_profile ~/.bash_profile`
    * `$ ln -s bashrc ~/.bashrc`
    * `$ ln -s git/config ~/.gitconfig`
    * `$ ln -s git/ignore ~/.gitingore`

Credit: the original idea for the contents of my dotfiles came from
PeepCode's excellent screencasts [Meet the Command Line][1] and [Advanced
Command Line][2].
