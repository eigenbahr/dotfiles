Dotfiles
========

This project contains important shell dotfiles, environment config,
aliases, git config, etc, that I want to keep across machines. It uses [dotdrop](https://deadc0de.re/dotdrop/) to manage profiles across hosts.

To use this project:

* Clone this repository.
* Install the dotfiles:

        `$ ./dotdrop.sh install`
  <or>
        `$ ./dotdrop.sh update`
